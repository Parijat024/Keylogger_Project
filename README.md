# Keylogger_Project
This is our final year project of the B.tech.<br />
INTRODUCTION:
In the digital age, where computers and the internet are ubiquitous, the need for tools to monitor and secure digital activities has become increasingly important. One such tool is the keylogger, a software application designed to record keystrokes made by a user on a computer keyboard. Originally developed for legitimate purposes such as debugging software and monitoring employee activity, keyloggers have evolved to serve a variety of functions, both benign and malicious.
The primary function of a keylogger is to capture and log all keystrokes entered by a user, including passwords, emails, chat messages, and other sensitive information. This data can be invaluable for various purposes, including forensic analysis, parental control, and user behavior monitoring. However, keyloggers can also be used for nefarious purposes, such as stealing personal information, monitoring user activity without consent, and facilitating cybercrime.<br />
